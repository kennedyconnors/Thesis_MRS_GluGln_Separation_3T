# Glutamate and Glutamine Separation Using MRS at 3T

This repository contains all MATLAB code, simulation data, and figure generation scripts developed for the thesis project:

*“Development and Optimization of a Hybrid Multi-Echo-Time PRESS Protocol for Glutamate and Glutamine Separation at 3T.”*

The project focuses on the simulation-based evaluation and optimization of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-MRS) acquisition strategies—specifically multi-echo-time (multi-TE) PRESS—for improving the separation and quantification of glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) in pediatric brain imaging at 3 Tesla. All simulations were performed using SpinWizard 1.1 and MATLAB R2024b, with no empirical or phantom data.
